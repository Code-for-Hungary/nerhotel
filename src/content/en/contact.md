# About K-Monitor

K-Monitor strives against corruption and promotes the transparency of public spending in Hungary. We operate open data websites, conduct research and advocate for legal reform. We truly believe that information technology can contribute to a more open, more transparent and more democratic way of governing.
Principles of our operation are openness, independence and a critical approach.
