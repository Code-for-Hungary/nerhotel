# What is Hotel Oligarch?

Hungarian public discourse has long been characterised by the aspiration of the political elite to create an aligned class. With the right connections and political backing, it is possible to acquire considerable wealth in just a few years through targeted public procurements, non-repayable grants and soft loans. Today, in the tourism sector, the businesses that benefit from these processes have become unavoidable, with hundreds of hotels and restaurants being taken over by politically connected actors. As customers we still have the opportunity to vote with our wallets against the further expansion of the politically backed entrepreneurial class.
  
The Hungarian name of the site (NER Hotel) refers to the System of National Cooperation (NER) introduced by the governing party that has led Hungary since 2010.

**Hotel Oligarch is a web-based application that makes the ownership and management of Hungarian tourism establishments more transparent. It helps you to find out who profits when you book a table in a restaurant or stay in a hotel.**

The content of the site is produced by K-Monitor using the following methodology. The site was developed by [Code for Hungary](https://code4.hu/) volunteers. The tool is [open source](https://github.com/Code-for-Hungary/nerhotel), so it can be freely developed, adapted and used.

## What kind of places are presented?

Hotel Oligarch includes hospitality, accommodation and tourism establishments that are linked to politically exposed persons (PEPs), as in the profits are realized by such actors. It may happen that the owner of a property is different from the owner of the opearating company, in which case the latter is taken as the basis, since the profits accrue directly to the operator. Politically exposed persons are primarily considered to be prominent public figures, their close relatives and persons closely associated with them, as defined in Article 4 of Act LIII of 2017. In order to identify PEPs in the tourism industry, Hotel Oligarch - in line with international auditing standards - uses a broader definition: this includes decision-makers in local governments, heads of governmental organisations in the tourism sector, and persons who, based on their press profile, have extensive links with a politically exposed person.

Hotel Oligarch aims to provide credible and structured information on the tourism interests of such people, and serve as a guide in making informed consumer choices.
